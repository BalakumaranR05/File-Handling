# User Registration

This is a simple user registration system implemented using Python and Tkinter GUI library. The system allows users to register with a valid email address and password, and also provides login and forgot password functionality.

## Features

The User Registration project provides the following features:

- **User registration with email validation**: Users can register by entering a valid email address and password. The system validates the email address to ensure it follows the correct format.
- **Password validation**: The system validates the password to ensure it meets certain requirements, such as minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, and special character requirements. This helps to ensure that users choose strong passwords.
- **Login with username and password**: Registered users can log in to the system using their username and password. The system verifies the credentials and grants access if they are correct.
- **Forgot password functionality**: The system allows users to retrieve their password if they forget it. Users can click on the "Forgot password" button in the login window and enter their username. If the username exists in the system, the password will be displayed.
- **GUI implemented using Tkinter**: The graphical user interface (GUI) of the User Registration system is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python, which provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.


## Usage

Here's how you can use the User Registration system:

1. Register a new user by entering a valid email address and password in the registration window. The system will validate the email address and password according to the requirements.
2. Login with the registered username and password in the login window. The system will verify the credentials and grant access if they are correct.
3. If you forget your password, click on the "Forgot password" button in the login window and enter your username. Your password will be displayed if the username exists in the system.
4. To exit the application, click on the "OK" or "X" button in the windows.
